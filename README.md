## Release Notes

**v1.1.1** - Minor storage bug fix

**v1.1.0** - Subtitle delay support for videos using the JW Player

**v1.0** - Video delay and UI foundation

## Limitations

- Video delay is only active while fullscreen
- Subtitle delay is unsupported for videos not using the JW Player
- Subtitles are currently burned into the delayed video and are not their own dedicated layer, thus the subtitle quality scales with video resolution and is not fixed as high quality
- Having browser graphics acceleration enabled can result in screen tearing with TVs
- DRM content is unsupported (use OBS fullscreen preview to delay the entire screenâ€”correctly doing this is complicated)
